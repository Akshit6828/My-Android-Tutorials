/*POST and GET are two methods to send and respond request to the server.
But we prefer POST over GET due to following reasons:
 1. More Secure(Donot show data in Url when we request/respond in JSON format)
 2. It can show large amount of data as compared to GET.
 3. It Shows Audio/Video/Jpg/Png/Pdf and etc formats while the GET only shows textual Information.

 $_POST['name']: used below with variables like address,email,gender,age,phone,password
 all will be sent togeather only as in single condition and for this reason only we have used '&&' Operator.
 
 'isset()' is a function which checks that whether a request of variable inside
 POST['variable_name']is Coming or Not through POST function

Checking request of variables.
 NOTE: We Wont Check ID as it is AUTO INCREMENTABLE.EVEN WHILE INPUTTING THE DATA WE DONT ASK USER ABOUT THE ID*/
